module ZK
  # Represents a single path in zookeeper, and can perform operations from the
  # perspective of that path. Operations performed through a Znode object will
  # return Znode instances where appropriate
  #
  # A Znode instance has a path, and will cache the last-known stat object and
  # node data.
  #
  # Znodes will do optimistic locking by default, and will throw a
  # ZK::Exceptions::BadVersion error if you attempt to update a node and its
  # been changed behind your back
  #
  module Znode
    # When a node is loaded, we apply a simple heuristic to determine if it's a
    # sequential node (as there's no way of knowing except based on the name) so if the 
    # basename of the node matches <tt>/\d{10}\Z/</tt>, we set sequential? to
    # true. ephemeral? is based off of the stat object.
